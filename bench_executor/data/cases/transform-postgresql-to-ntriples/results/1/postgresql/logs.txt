********************************************************************************
WARNING: POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD has been set to "trust". This will allow
         anyone with access to the Postgres port to access your database without
         a password, even if POSTGRES_PASSWORD is set. See PostgreSQL
         documentation about "trust":
         https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-trust.html
         In Docker's default configuration, this is effectively any other
         container on the same system.
         It is not recommended to use POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust. Replace
         it with "-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password" instead to set a password in
         "docker run".
********************************************************************************
The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".
This user must also own the server process.
The database cluster will be initialized with locale "en_US.utf8".
The default database encoding has accordingly been set to "UTF8".
The default text search configuration will be set to "english".
Data page checksums are disabled.
