# EXEC (EXperiment ExeCutor)

EXEC (EXperiment ExeCutor) is a simple tool to execute benchmarks
on tools which are running in Docker. EXEC exposes a CLI interface `exectool`.

## How to use?

You can list all options and arguments with `--help`

```
usage: exectool [-h] [--version] [--root MAIN_DIRECTORY] [--runs NUMBER_OF_RUNS] [--interval INTERVAL] [--verbose] [--wait-for-user]
                [--smtp-server SMTP_SERVER] [--smtp-port SMTP_PORT] [--smtp-username SMTP_USERNAME] [--smtp-password SMTP_PASSWORD]
                [--smtp-sender SMTP_SENDER] [--smtp-receiver SMTP_RECEIVER]

positional arguments:
  command               Command to execute, available commands: "list", "run"

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  --root MAIN_DIRECTORY
                        Root directory of all cases to execute, defaults to the current working directory
  --runs NUMBER_OF_RUNS
                        Number of runs to execute a case. The value must be uneven for generating stats. Default 3 runs
  --interval INTERVAL   Measurement sample interval for metrics, default 0.1s
  --verbose             Turn on verbose output
  --wait-for-user       Show a prompt when a step is executed before going to the next one
  --smtp-server SMTP_SERVER
                        SMTP server to use for sending e-mails
  --smtp-port SMTP_PORT
                        SMTP port to use for sending e-mails
  --smtp-username SMTP_USERNAME
                        Username to authenticate with SMTP server for sending e-mails
  --smtp-password SMTP_PASSWORD
                        Password to authenticate with SMTP server for sending e-mails
  --smtp-sender SMTP_SENDER
                        Sender's e-mailaddress for sending e-mails
  --smtp-receiver SMTP_RECEIVER
                        Receiver's e-mailaddress for sending emails
```

### Generating cases

Each case you want to execute expects the following structure:

```
/path/to/my/case
├── data
│   └── shared
│       ├── file1
│       ├── file2
│       └── file3
└── metadata.json
```

Data shared among resources should be stored under the `./data/shared` folder
of the case, the steps to execute should be stored in `./metadata.json`.

The steps are described as followed:

```
{
    "@id": "http://example.com/case/ID", # Unique IRI for your case
    "name": "Case X: Apple: Pie", # Readable name for your case
    "description": "Bananas", # Readable description for your case
    "steps": [
        {
            "@id": "http://example.com/case/ID#step1", # Unique IRI for your step
            "name": "My Step Description", # Readable name of your step
            "resource": "$RESOURCE", # Name of resource to execute, matching $RESOURCE.py
            "command": "$METHOD", # Method to execute of the resource, defined in $RESOURCE.py
            "parameters": { # Parameters to supply with the method to execute, defined in $RESOURCE.py
                "param1": "MyParameter",
                "param2": 5
            }
        },
        ... # Infinite number of steps allowed
    ]
}
```

Real examples can be found under [bench_executor/data/test-cases/](bench_executor/data/test-cases/).

### Listing all cases

You can list all cases from a certain root folder with:

```
exectool list
```

By default, the root directory is set to the current working directory.
If you want to set a different one, use the `--root` argument:

```
exectool list --root=/path/to/your/cases
```

### Running all cases

Running all cases under a root directory is similar to listing them:

```
exectool run
```

If you want to specify the number of runs, metrics collection interval, 
and the root directory:

```
exectool list --root=/path/to/your/cases --runs=5 --interval 1.0
```

This will execute all cases at `/path/to/your/cases`,
each case will be executed 5 times,
and the metrics will be collected every `1.0` seconds.

#### Additional features

If you want to pause the execution of your case after each step,
you can add the `--wait-for-user` argument when running the cases:

```
exectool run --wait-for-user
```

This way, you can debug resources when they are not working properly or testing
your setup.

### Cleaning all cases

Sometimes you want to start from a clean slate, you can clean all cases under 
the given root directory with:

```
exectool clean
```

All collected metrics and log files will be deleted, be careful!
